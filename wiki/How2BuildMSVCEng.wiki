You can see ACE_wrappers folder in above picture. It’s ACE library. 

Here's simple steps for build.
 * Download the source code or get it from SVN
 * Open the solution file(`HalfNetwork_vc8` or `_vc9`) with MSVC
 * Build all projects

When the build is finished, you can find the library and executable files in Bin32(or Bin64) folder.
